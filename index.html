      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p>I"m either on a plane and excited, or watching planes and jealous. Being raised in a place that you knew, from the earliest cognitive grasps, that you didn't belong set up a future of wandering. I love being home, but I love being out of my element, taking in new culture, language, &amp traditions. Global peace would be greatly enhanced if more of us purposfully exposed ourselves to that which is not like us. Do it.  Push your boundries - both emotional and physical. Treat your senses - taste, sight, sound and smell. And do it soon!</p>

        <h3>Adult on-set passion for code</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p>After leaving a career in finance, and working with an execitive coach, I was 'diagnosed' as a 'creative-type'.  Sounds great, now. At the time, it felt like a terminal diagnosis. I didn't know a thing about creativity. I was a CFO! Thanks to the steady hand of a talented coach, I enrolled in a Ruby/Rails bootcamp in Boston.  After 12 weeks I discovered not only that I was creative, but that my destiny was in Front End Development.  A discovered passion at 36 years of age.</p>

        <h3>The ever balanced Libra</h3>

      <div class="back">
        <p>I approach the on-line experience from both the right and left-brain.  I learn from both construction and deconstruction.  These balances have been the guiding principles in my life and are so beautifully applied to my educational endeavor in code.</p>
